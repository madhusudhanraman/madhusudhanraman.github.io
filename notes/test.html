<h1>Differential Forms, Integration and Hamiltonian Dynamics</h1>

This text discusses differential forms, invariant integration on arbitrary manifolds and the geometrical formulation of Hamiltonian dynamics.

<h2>Differential Forms</h2>

Differential forms are gorgeous little beasts that are commonly found lurking under integral signs.

A differential form of order \( p\) (or a \( p\)-form) is a totally antisymmetric \( (0,p)\) tensor. For example, \( \mathrm{d} x^\mu\) is a 1-form and may be thought of as a line element.

<h3>Wedge and Exterior Products</h3>

One can define a product on two 1-forms called a wedge product. This is an antisymmetrized tensor product. For example, a 2-form is
\[
\mathrm{d} x^\mu \wedge \mathrm{d} x^\nu = \mathrm{d} x^\mu \otimes \mathrm{d} x^\nu - \mathrm{d} x^\nu \otimes \mathrm{d} x^\mu
\]
and, in general, an \(p\)-form may be constructed out of \( p\) 1-forms as
\[
\mathrm{d} x^{\mu_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathrm{d} x^{\mu_p} = \sum_{P \in \mathrm{Sym(p)}} \mathrm{sgn}(P) \ \mathrm{d} x^{\mu_{P(1)}} \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathrm{d} x^{\mu_{P(p)}} ,
\]
where \( \mathrm{Sym(p)}\) is the symmetric group of order \( p\). It follows from the above definition that if any two indices in a \( p\)-form take the same value, then the \( p\)-form is zero due to antisymmetry. Further, shuffling the order of the 1-forms will result in the \( p\)-form picking up a sign that depends on whether the permutation is odd or even.
If we denote the space of \( p\)-forms at a point \( q \in M\) as \( \Omega^p_q(M)\), then the aforementioned set of \( p\)-forms form a basis for this space. Note, however, that for the purposes of this series of notes, we will often omit the subscript \( q\)! Any \( \omega \in \Omega^p(M)\) is expanded as
\[
\omega = \frac{1}{p!}\omega_{\mu_1 \cdots \mu_p} \mathrm{d} x^{\mu_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathrm{d} x^{\mu_p}
\]
and the components \( \omega_{\mu_1 \cdots \mu_p}\) are totally antisymmetric under exchange of two indices, reflecting the antisymmetry of the basis.
Now that we have a vector space of \( p\)-forms, we may ask what the dimension of such a space is. If our manifold is \( n\)-dimensional, then the answer is simply the number of ways one may choose \( p\) numbers out of \( n\) to take the place of indices \( (\mu_1, \cdots ,\mu_p)\), or
\[
\mathrm{dim} \  \Omega^p(M) = \binom{n}{p} = \frac{n!}{p! (n-p)!} .
\]
There are a few points one should note. Firstly, we may identify \( \Omega^1(M)\) with the cotangent space \( T^*(M)\). Secondly, because of the properties of binomial coefficients, we have
\[
\mathrm{dim} \  \Omega^p(M) = \mathrm{dim} \  \Omega^{n-p}(M)
\]
or that the vector spaces \( \Omega^p(M)\) and \( \Omega^{n-p}(M)\) are isomorphic. Lastly, if \( p > n\) then the form vanishes identically as some index must be repeated in the antisymmetrized sum.
An exterior product is a product defined by trivial and symmetrized extension; for a \( p\)-form \( \omega\) and a \( q\)-form \( \xi\), we have
\[
\wedge: \Omega^p(M) \times \Omega^q(M) \rightarrow \Omega^{p+q}(M)
\]
such that
\[
(\omega \wedge \xi)(V_1,\cdots ,V_{p+q}) = \frac{1}{p!q!} \sum_{\mathrm{Sym}(p+q)} \mathrm{sgn}(P) \ \omega(V_{P(1)}, \cdots , V_{P(p)}) \ \xi(V_{P(p+1)}, \cdots , V_{P(p+q)}) ,
\]
so, as one might expect, this product is zero if \( p+q > n\). With this product, we can define
\[
\Omega^*(M) = \Omega^0(M) \oplus \Omega^1(M) \oplus \cdots \oplus \Omega^n(M)
\]
which denotes the algebra of differential forms on \( M\) that is closed under the exterior product.
The following properties are easily verified. For a \( p\)-form \( \omega\), a \( q\)-form \( \xi\) and a \( s\)-form \( \eta\), we have:
\begin{eqnarray}
\omega \wedge \omega &=& 0 \quad (\mathrm{odd} \ p) \\
\xi \wedge \eta &=& (-1)^{qs} \eta \wedge \xi \\
(\xi \wedge \eta ) \wedge \omega &=& \xi \wedge (\eta \wedge \omega)
\end{eqnarray}

<h3>Exterior Derivatives</h3>

An exterior derivative is a map
\[
\mathrm{d} : \Omega^p(M) \rightarrow \Omega^{p+1}(M)
\]
and is defined to act on an \( p\)-form \( \omega\) as
\[
\mathrm{d} \omega = \frac{1}{p!} \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\nu} \omega_{\mu_1 \cdots \mu_p} \right) \mathrm{d} x^\nu \wedge \mathrm{d} x^{\mu_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathrm{d} x^{\mu_p} .
\]
The exterior derivative obeys the graded Leibniz rule; for a \( p\)-form \( \omega\) and a \( q\)-form \( \eta\), we have
\[
\mathrm{d} (\omega \wedge \eta) = \mathrm{d} \omega \wedge \eta + (-1)^p \ \omega \wedge \mathrm{d} \eta .
\]
The rule is simple enough to remember: if the exterior derivative "jumps over" a \( p\)-form, then the term picks up a factor of \( (-1)^p\).
The following formula is quite useful: for \( \omega \in \Omega^1(M)\) and \( X, Y \in \mathscr{X}\), we have
\[
\mathrm{d} \omega(X,Y) = X[\omega(Y)] - Y[\omega(X)] - \omega([X,Y]) .
\]
It is easy to see that the the exterior derivative is nilpotent, i.e. that
\[
\mathrm{d}^2 = 0 .
\]
In fact, this follows from the manner in which \( \mathrm{d}\) acts on a \( p\)-form \( \omega\). If \( \mathrm{d}\) acts twice, we get
\[
\mathrm{d}^2 \omega = \frac{1}{p!} \left(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^\rho \partial x^\sigma} \omega_{\mu_1 \cdots \mu_p} \right) \mathrm{d} x^\rho \wedge \mathrm{d} x^\sigma \wedge \mathrm{d} x^{\mu_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathrm{d} x^{\mu_p} ,
\]
which vanishes identically as the second derivative in the brackets is symmetric under \( \rho \leftrightarrow \sigma\) but \( \mathrm{d} x^\rho \wedge \mathrm{d} x^\sigma\) is antisymmetric under this exchange.

Differential forms may be pulled back; if \( f: M \rightarrow N\) and \( \omega, \eta \in \Omega^p(N)\), then
\[
(f^* \omega)(X_1, \cdots , X_p) = \omega(f_* X_1, \cdots , f_* X_p),
\]
as is straightforwardly generalized from the analogous property for 1-forms. Further, exterior derivation and products "commute" with pullbacks, so
\[
\mathrm{d} (f^* \omega) = f^* (\mathrm{d} \omega)
\]
and
\[
f^* (\omega \wedge \eta) = (f^* \omega) \wedge (f^* \eta) .
\]
The exterior derivative will important when discussing the de Rham complex and the associated cohomology groups.

<h3>Interior Products and Lie's Magic Formula</h3>
An interior product \( i_X : \Omega^p(M) \rightarrow \Omega^{p-1}(M)\) is defined for \( X \in \mathscr{X}\) and \( \omega \in \Omega^p(M)\) as
\[
i_X \omega (X_1 , \cdots , X_{p-1}) = \omega (X, X_1 , \cdots , X_{p-1})
\]
or, in terms of components with \( X = X^\mu \partial_\mu\) and \( \omega = (1/p!) \omega_{\mu_1 \cdots \mu_p} \mathrm{d} x^{\mu_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathrm{d} x^{\mu_p}\), we have
\[
i_X \omega = \frac{1}{p!} \sum_{j=1}^{p} X^{\mu_j} \omega_{\mu_1 \cdots \mu_j \cdots \mu_p} (-1)^{j-1} \mathrm{d} x^{\mu_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \hat{\mathrm{d} x^{\mu_j}} \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathrm{d} x^{\mu_p}
\]
where, in the sum, the term with the hat is omitted.

The Lie derivative of a form may now be very neatly expressed in terms of the exterior and interior derivatives as
\[
\mathcal{L}_X \omega = (\mathrm{d} i_X + i_X \mathrm{d}) \omega .
\]
Listed below are a number of cute properties the interior derivative possesses; for \( \omega \in \Omega^p(M)\) and \( X,Y \in \mathscr{X}\) we have
\[
i_{[X,Y]} \omega = X (i_Y \omega) - Y (i_X \omega)
\]
and
\[
i_X (\omega \wedge \eta) = i_X \omega \wedge \eta + (-1)^p \omega \wedge i_X \eta
\]
and
\[
i_X^2 = 0
\]
and, as a consequence of nilpotency,
\[
\mathcal{L}_X i_X \omega = i_X \mathcal{L}_X \omega .
\]

<h2>Integration</h2>

<h3>Volume Forms</h3>

Integrating differential forms is only defined when the manifold is orientable, i.e. if, for any pair of overlapping charts \( U_i\) and \( U_j\) with, say, coordinate functions \( \{x^\mu\}\) and \( \{y^\nu\}\) respectively, the Jacobian of the coordinate transformation
\[
J = \mathrm{det} \left( \frac{\partial x^\mu}{\partial y^\nu} \right)
\]
is positive. 

For an \( n\)-manifold \( M\) that is orientable, there exists a nowhere vanishing \( n\)-form called a volume element which plays the role of a measure when you integrate a function \( f \in \mathscr{F}(M)\) over \( M\). Two \( n\)-forms are \( \omega\) and \( \omega'\) are considered equivalent if they are related to each other as \( \omega' = h \omega\), where \( h \in \mathscr{F}(M)\) is a strictly positive function. If the function is strictly negative, then the orientation is reversed; in this way, \( n\)-forms on an orientable manifold are partitioned into two classes -- one with an orientation (say, right-handed) and the other with the opposite orientation (say, left-handed).

To clarify these ideas further it is profitable to study these forms in their local coordinate presentation. Consider a manifold \( M\) with an open set \( U_i\) that is, in turn, coordinatized by the function \( x = \varphi(p)\), where \( p \in M\). The local coordinate version of this volume form is
\[
\omega = h(p) \mathrm{d} x^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathrm{d} x^n ,
\]
where \( h(p)\) is strictly positive on the open set \( U_i\). The orientability of \( M\) implies that \( \omega\) can be extended throughout \( M\), and \( h\) is a function that is positive definite throughout \( M\). For example, on the intersection of two open sets with coordinates \( \{ x^\mu \}\) and \( \{ y^\nu \}\), the volume form in the \( y\)-coordinate presentation differs from the volume form in the \( x\)-coordinate presentation simply by a Jacobian factor, which we have already mentioned is positive if the manifold is to be orientable.

If \( M\) is not orientable, an \( \omega\) with a strictly positive \( h\) cannot be defined throughout \( M\). It should also be noted that in the presence of a metric, there is a canonical choice of volume form. We will talk about this in [[GAPIII]].

<h3>Partitions of Unity and Integration</h3>
We now address the following question: how does one integrate a function \( f : M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\)? We'll answer this question in two steps: first, how do we integrate over open sets on manifolds, and second, how do we extend this notion of integration so that we may integrate functions over entire manifolds?

To answer our question, consider an open set \( U_i\) that is coordinatized by the function \( x = \varphi(p)\). We define integration using the volume form \( \omega\) as
\[
\int_{U_i} f \omega = \int_{\varphi(U_i)} f(\varphi_i^{-1}(x)) h(\varphi_i^{-1}(x)) \mathrm{d} x^1 \cdots \mathrm{d} x^n ,
\]
which will be recognized as an ordinary multiple integral that is straightforwardly computable.

Now, to answer the question of how to extend this notion of integration to cover the entire manifold, we introduce a topological property called paracompactness and, associated with it a notion referred to as a partition of unity.

A manifold is paracompact if any open covering of \( M\) satisfies the following property: any point \( p \in M\) is contained in some finite number of open sets. 

For a partition of unity, we need the following ingredients: a set of differentiable functions \( \{ \epsilon_i (p) \}\) such that
# \( 0 \leq \epsilon_i (p) \leq 1\),
# \( \epsilon_i (p) = 0\) if \( p \notin U_i\), and
# the sum of all \( \epsilon_i (p)\) is unity for any point \( p \in M\).

The partition of unity allows us to redefine the integral as a (finite) sum, allowing us to write
\[
f(p) = \sum_i f(p) \epsilon_i (p) = \sum_i f_i (p) ,
\]
which in turn allows us to define our integral of the function over the manifold as
\[
\int_M f \omega = \sum_i \int_{U_i} f_i \omega .
\]

<h2>Hamiltonian Dynamics</h2>

Let \( H\) be a Hamiltonian and the coordinates \( (q^\mu , p_\mu)\) span the phase space. Introduce the canonical 1-form
\[
\theta = p_\mu \mathrm{d} q^\mu
\]
and define a symplectic 2-form as
\[
\omega = \mathrm{d} \theta = \mathrm{d} p_\mu \wedge \mathrm{d} q^\mu .
\]

<h3>Hamiltonian Vector Fields</h3>

Now define, given a function \( f\) on phase space, a Hamiltonian vector field
\[
X_f = \frac{\partial f}{\partial p_\mu} \partial_{q^\mu} - \frac{\partial f}{\partial q^\mu} \partial_{p_\mu}
\]
so that
\[
i_{X_f} \omega = - \frac{\partial f}{\partial p_\mu} \mathrm{d} p_\mu - \frac{\partial f}{\partial q^\mu} \mathrm{d} q^\mu = - \mathrm{d} f .
\]
Now let the function \( f\) be the Hamiltonian itself; the associated Hamiltonian vector field is, then
\[
X_H = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_\mu} \partial_{q^\mu} - \frac{\partial H}{\partial q^\mu} \partial_{p_\mu}
\]
and, using Hamilton's equations, we see
\[
X_H = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \quad \mathrm{and} \quad i_{X_H} \omega = -\mathrm{d} H .
\]
Thus, the symplectic 2-form \( \omega\) is preserved by the flow generated by the Hamiltonian vector field as, due to Lie's Magic Formula
\[
\mathcal{L}_{X_H} \omega = (\mathrm{d} i_{X_H} + i_{X_H} \mathrm{d}) \omega = - \mathrm{d}^2 H = 0
\]
where we have used the fact that the symplectic 2-form is closed.

Conversely, for a Hamiltonian vector field \( X\) that preserves the symplectic 2-form, there exists a Hamiltonian \( H\) as
\[
\mathcal{L}_X \omega = \mathrm{d}(i_X \omega) = 0
\]
by assumption, so by Poincare's Lemma, we have
\[
i_X \omega = - \mathrm{d} H .
\]
Thus, Hamilton's equations are satisfied along the \( \omega\) preserving flows generated by \( X\).
